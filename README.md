# What2Watch

A site that allows the user to search through movies &amp; Tv Shows and view details about the content. If the user can't think of something to watch the site can also recommend that.

I decided to make this site as one of my favourite pasttime activities is watching movies and tv shows, however sometimes it may be difficult to find new content to watch with the vast amount that is available and thats when I had the idea for this site.

+ Search for Movies, Tv Shows OR People individually to get more specific content.
+ View Top Rated Movies or Tv Shows based on the IMDB best rated list.
+ View currently Trending Movies or Tv Shows.

+ Get suggestions for random good rated and/or trending Movies or Tv Shows.
